# Movie-Database

For this module 12 mini-project, I built REST API routes in order to create, retrieve, and delete movies from a MySQL database.

## User Story

As a user, I want to create a new database to store movie names and reviews into two separate tables with a list of all of the movies. 

I would also want to be able to add and deleted movies on said database.

Lastly, a list of all of the movies and its reviews should be returned to me.

## Acceptance Criteria

When it's done, movie_db (the movie database) has been created. It has to contain a movies and reviews table. It should then be seeded with data.

Along with that, with the usage of Insomnia, the /api/add-movie route has to successfully pass a test by add movies. 

The test to update a movie has to also be done using Insomnia and it requires the use /api/update-review route to fully accomplish its goal. 

Finally, the /api/movie/:id route has to be able to complete a deletion using Insomnia.
